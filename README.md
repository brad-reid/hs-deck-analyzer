# hs-deck-analyzer
Analyze Hearthstone decks using Track-o-bot data.

Provides reports aimed at helping players make deck building, mulligan and game play decisions.
The report format is also designed to make it easy to include your analysis results in reddit posts.

## Getting Started

You'll need to run the analyzer yourself for your game data.

### Prerequisites

#### Track-o-bot

You need to be using Track-o-bot. For details on installing and using Track-o-bot, visit:
https://trackobot.com/

#### Python

You'll need to install python 3 on your system if you don't have it already.
For details on downloading and installing python, visit:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### Git

Using git will make it easy to check out and run a copy of the analyzer.
For details on downloading and installing git, visit:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Installing

Assuming you've met the prerequisites and have both Python and Git installed, from a command prompt:
* Navigate to the directory where you want to install it.
* git clone https://github.com/brad-reid/hs-deck-analyzer.git
* cd hs-deck-analyzer
* pip install -r requirements.txt

At this point it should be runnable. Get your Track-o-bot username and API token. If you've never done this before, here are
instructions for Windows:
* Find the Track-o-bot icon in your system tray if it is running. If it's not running, run it.
* Right click on it and choose 'Open Profile' which takes you to your Track-o-bot web page.
* Click on the gear icon dropdown, on the upper right nav for the page, and choose 'API'.
* Click the 'Reveal' button to find your API token.

Now you're ready to run the script. If you're on windows, you may need to add python to your PATH environment variable.
The [python windows installation guide](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) has some instructions for
[configuring python and finding the python executable](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable)

### Running

Run using data fetched from Track-o-bot:
```
> py hs-deck-analyzer.py -u little-tundra-rhino-2171 -t <API_TOKEN> -c Rogue -s 5
```

Run using game data stored in a json file:
```
> py hs-deck-analyzer.py -i trackobot_games.json -c Rogue -s 5
```

### Caveats

The Track-o-bot deck recognition is behind the times, which makes it useless. Because of that, the script only recognizes the hero classes, not specific decks.
If you play multiple archetypes for the same hero, this might make the analysis less useful, especially if there's a lot of card overlap.
Since opponents are only listed by hero and not deck type, when looking at results you also have to keep in mind what kind of decks you were facing.

The script only gets data for the last 10 days since the Track-o-bot data store ages out the card history data after 10 days.
You'll need to store the Track-o-bot data that includes the card history yourself if you want to be able to analyze it again in the future.

## TODO/Wishlist

* Deck identification. Ideally we'd be able to track decks by deck code.
* Deck level breakdowns. The main limiting factor I see is the low quality deck detection that's currently in track-o-bot. Very few of the current meta decks are currently supported.
* Deck versioning support. Decks usually go through several iterations.
   Being able to classify and analyze the different versions would be nice. You can sort of get there by hand classifying decks in Track-o-bot.
   Maybe making use of the game annotation system in Track-o-bot would work.
* Get Track-o-bot to store more data like, mulligan info and cards drawn. This would open up new analyses.
* HSTeamPlay integration. There are several challenges here. It can only analyze data by watching your game log. It is written in go, but there is a [python trueskill](http://trueskill.org/) package.
* Make it even easier for players to use. Having to install python and run the script by hand will be a barrier for some players. Maybe hosted as a web app somewhere? Maybe as a HS Deck Tracker plugin?

## Rogue Matchup Win Rates
Opponents are ordered by frequency, making it easy to see performance against the most common matchups.
This data helps answer questions about how well your hero is performing against the meta you're facing
and how well you're performing against the opponents you are targeting.

| opponent   |   games |   wins |   losses |   win % |
|:-----------|--------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|
| All        |      50 |     28 |       22 |   56.00 |
| Rogue      |      15 |      8 |        7 |   53.33 |
| Priest     |      11 |      6 |        5 |   54.55 |
| Warlock    |       8 |      4 |        4 |   50.00 |
| Druid      |       7 |      4 |        3 |   57.14 |
| Shaman     |       4 |      3 |        1 |   75.00 |
| Hunter     |       2 |      1 |        1 |   50.00 |
| Mage       |       2 |      2 |        0 |  100.00 |
| Warrior    |       1 |      0 |        1 |    0.00 |

## Card Win Rates
Cards are ordered by win rate. Played % shows the percentage of games where you played the card.
Track-o-bot only has data for the cards played, so the unplayed columns are
attempting to help answer questions about how the deck performs when you don't draw that card or it sits in your hand.
Note that data is only shown when a card is played on a turn at least 5 times.

| card vs. All         |   wins |   win % |   games |   played % |   unplayed wins |   unplayed losses |   unplayed win % |

## Win Rates When Playing Cards on Specific Turns
Note that data is only shown when a card is played on a turn at least 5 times.
This data attempts to help answer questions about what cards you should mulligan for and which plays are strongest.
Furthermore, it can help validate whether your playstyle and plan for the deck is working.

## Mana Differential Win Rates
This is the difference in mana spent between you and your opponent.
Game % shows the percentage of games where this mana differential occurred.
Note that the game winner will usually take the last turn, which probably helps pad the mana spent in their favor.

| mana differential              |   games |   games % |   wins |   losses |   win % |
|:-------------------------------|--------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|
| big disadvantage:          -8+ |      10 |     20.00 |      1 |        9 |   10.00 |
| slight disadvantage: -7 to -3  |      10 |     20.00 |      2 |        8 |   20.00 |
| about even:          -2 to  2  |      10 |     20.00 |      8 |        2 |   80.00 |
| slight advantage:     3 to  7  |      15 |     30.00 |     13 |        2 |   86.67 |

## Ladder Rank Win Rates
This shows how the hero performed at the different ladder ranks.
This should help you gauge whether or not games at easier ranks are affecting the stats.
